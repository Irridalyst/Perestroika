= The Ratification of the Belavezha Accords

The Supreme Soviet has voted to ratify the Belavezha Accords, officially recognizing the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The agreement, signed earlier by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, replaces the USSR with a new entityâ€”the *Commonwealth of Independent States*. With this act, the Soviet constitution is rendered void, and the institutions that governed nearly a sixth of the Earth vanish into history.

The hammer and sickle has fallen, and the Russian tricolor now flies above the Kremlin.

What was once unthinkable is now law. The Soviet Union no longer exists.
