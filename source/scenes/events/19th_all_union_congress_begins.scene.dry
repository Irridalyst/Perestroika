= 19th All-Union Party Conference Opens

For the first time since 1938, a Party Conference has been called—signaling the depth of the crisis facing the Soviet Union and the growing momentum for reform. Convened in Moscow, this extraordinary session brings together almost 5,000 delegates from across the Union. Delegates from every union republic, trade union, and branch of the Party have gathered in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses to debate Gorbachev’s proposed political reforms. The Politburo, previously immune from public scrutiny, now faces pointed questions from below.

General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev opens the proceedings with a sweeping address calling for the democratization of Soviet society, a revitalization of Leninist norms, and structural reform to the political system. He advocates for multi-candidate elections, enhanced local autonomy, and greater press freedom under the framework of glasnost and perestroika. Gorbachev frames the moment as a struggle between renewal and stagnation[? if old_guard_empowered > 0: —a clear challenge to the entrenched old guard resisting reform within the Party itself. ?]

>*"The main danger is not reform, but the absence of it."*

– Mikhail Gorbachev, opening speech to the 19th Conference, June 1988.

The second day of the conference sees unusually candid and even combative speeches from delegates, a rarity in Party history. Reformists and conservatives clash openly over the future of Perestroika, glasnost, and the role of the Party in economic management.

Aleksei Sakharov, Boris Yeltsin, and others criticize the entrenched bureaucracy and the slow pace of change. Others, including Ligachyov, warn against abandoning the "leading role" of the CPSU. The airing of such differences marks a significant departure from the controlled party congresses of the past.

While delivering his address, Ligachyov began to utter the phrase "Boris, you are wrong" when referring to Yeltsin.

Tensions remain high. Gorbachev delivers a speech further affirming his commitment to glasnost, defending the controversial {!<span class="tooltip-text" title="Allowed for independent worker-owned cooperatives to operate in the Soviet Union">Law on Cooperatives</span>!} and calling for a clearer separation between Party and state functions.

He floats the possibility of constitutional reform but provides few details. Meanwhile, delegates begin to propose resolutions on political restructuring, anti-corruption, nationalities policy, and combating bureaucracy. Though still controlled, the conference takes on the tone of a legislative body rather than a Party meeting.

title: A New Legislative Body?
subtitle: July 1, 1988 (Morning)

On the final day of the conference, Gorbachev stuns the hall with a dramatic last-minute proposal: the creation of a new supreme legislative body—the *Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union*. Unlike the current system dominated entirely by Party organs, this Congress would be partially elected through multi-candidate, competitive elections, opening the door—albeit cautiously—to broader political participation.

The new Congress would in turn elect a smaller standing body, a reformed Supreme Soviet, which would serve as the day-to-day legislature. By proposing this structure, Gorbachev seeks to institutionalize glasnost and begin the long process of decoupling Party and state, while still preserving the Party's “guiding role.” The measure receives overwhelming support from the assembled delegates, many of whom see it as an unavoidable step forward.

But the proposal did not emerge from consensus—it emerged from conflict. In the days leading up to this final session, Gorbachev had grown increasingly frustrated with the intransigence of the Old Guard. Figures like Yegor Ligachyov had worked behind the scenes to dilute reformist resolutions, delay votes, and rally conservative support against opening up the Party's control of the state.

Realizing that the existing structures could no longer carry the weight of perestroika, Gorbachev turned to constitutional reform as a way to bypass internal resistance. By shifting legislative power into a newly elected body—one outside the direct control of the Central Committee—he hoped to isolate his opponents and rally popular legitimacy behind reform. In doing so, he effectively admitted that the Party itself could no longer be the sole engine of transformation.

The proposal is approved, but the split within the Party is no longer hidden—it is now on open display.
