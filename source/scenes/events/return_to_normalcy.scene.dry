= Return to Normalcy

The Soviet Union is finally emerging from its long economic malaise. As growth returns to key industrial sectors and inflation stabilizes, the political crisis that once threatened to break the Union begins to ease.

Now, the contradictions within the nationalist and anti-Soviet opposition are beginning to show. With improving conditions, many moderate republic leaders are re-engaging with the Union framework, while hardline separatists grow isolated. Tensions between pro-market liberals and ethnic nationalists have erupted into open disputes in several republics. Their unity shattered, these opposition groups are losing momentum, and the dream of dismantling the Union no longer seems inevitable.

- @celebrate: This is an occasion to celebrate.
- @complacency: Nationalists and anti-Soviet elements still pose a threat. We must not become complacent.

@celebrate

This is a moment to celebrate! The Union has weathered the storm, and the separatists are losing their grip. Ura! 

@complacency

Even in retreat, nationalist and anti-Soviet elements remain a danger. We must not become complacentâ€”they will try again.
