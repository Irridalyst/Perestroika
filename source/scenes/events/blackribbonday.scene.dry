= Black Ribbon Day Protests Sweep the Baltics

On August 23rd, 1987—the anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact—something extraordinary occurs in the Baltic Soviet republics. In Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius, thousands of Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians gather in solemn protest, defying official bans and decades of enforced silence. They come wearing black ribbons, carrying candles, and demanding recognition of the secret protocols that consigned their nations to Soviet rule. For many, this marks the first truly public expression of historical grievance since Stalin’s annexation of the region in 1940.

Organized by underground independence movements—like the Estonian Group for the Publication of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its Consequences—these protests build upon years of quiet dissidence and growing disillusionment with Moscow's control. The demonstrators chant for historical truth, national dignity, and basic rights, not yet full independence, but the demand for sovereignty simmers beneath the surface. KGB agents and party officials are caught off guard. While some demonstrators are detained, the sheer size and emotional power of the protests shake local Communist Party structures and spark international media attention.

What was once an émigré movement, born in exile from Canada to Sweden, has now breached the internal borders of the USSR. For the Kremlin, this is a troubling signal: the Baltic question is no longer buried. It has returned—and it is no longer only whispered in kitchens or remembered in exile. It is now chanted in the streets.
