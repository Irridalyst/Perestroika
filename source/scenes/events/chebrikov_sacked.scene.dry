= A Quiet Departure at the Lubyanka

Viktor Chebrikov, Chairman of the KGB since 1982, has been dismissed from his post. A holdover from the Andropov era, Chebrikov was known for his firm resistance to glasnost and his unwavering commitment to surveillance and internal control. While not publicly criticized, his departure signals a shift in the internal balance of power.

In his place, Vladimir Kryuchkov has been appointedâ€”nominally a loyal Gorbachev ally, though his true loyalties remain unclear. Reformers in the Politburo hail this as a necessary step in reining in the power of the security services. Hardliners, meanwhile, grumble that a vital pillar of state stability has just been removed.
